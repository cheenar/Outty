<h1>Outty</h1>
<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you wish you could switch your system audio output device quickly, with zero fuss? Doesn't it get tiring opening System Preferences and then selecting the output device? I thought so too, and I decided to whip up a quick solution</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p><a href="103 KBOutty.zip">Download</a> me right now and double click! No extra steps, the Outty logo will appear in your menu bar and you can start using it immediately! 
<br>
<br>
One quick note: If you attach a new output device, you will need to restart Outty! Automatically refreshing the list will be included in Outty 1.1!
</p>

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
